# Contributing to Furucombo

## Contribution guidelines

Base on the structure of Furucombo, there are several [guidelines](GUIDELINES.md) that you should follow. Please make sure to review the document.

## Creating pull requests (PRs)

Any direct modification to develop branch is prohibited. Please work on your own fork and submit pull requests. The PRs will be reviewed and commented. CI test should pass and every comment should be resolved before the PR is merged back to develop.

## A typical workflow

1. Make sure your fork is up-to-date.

```
cd furucombo-contract
git remote add upstream git@github.com:dinngodev/furucombo-contract.git
git pull upstream develop
```

2. Branch out from develop.

```
git checkout -b some-feature
```

3. Do your work and **Unit test**, commit.

```
git add contracts/yourFile.sol tests/yourFile.test.js
git commit "some-feature"
```

4. Update [changelog](CHANGELOG.md). Description should be written under proper tag in the **unreleased** section. You may refer to [here](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

5. Make sure everything is up-to-date before push.

```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/develop
git push -f origin some-feature
```

6. Issue a new PR.
